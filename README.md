# Image recognition-based calorie tracker

## Description

Imagine that you could show a dish to a machine learning algorithm and it would come back to you with the number of calories that it contained? In this project we have developed an image recognition-based calorie tracker.

## Set up

### Virtual Environment

In this project we use Python version `3.10` and Pipenv for managing virtual environments (see full documentation [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html)).

1 - Install `pipenv` (for Mac users you can also use `brew`)
```
pip install pipenv
```

2 - Create virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `Pipfile` (including `dev` dependencies)
```
pipenv install --dev
```

3 - Activate existing environment
```
pipenv shell
```

4 - Exit the environment
```
deactivate
```

5 - Remove current environment
```
pipenv --rm
```
